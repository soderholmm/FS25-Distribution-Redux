-- ============================================================================
-- DistributionAPI.lua  (Distribution Redux)
--
-- The public extension surface other mods build on. Currently one thing: a mod
-- may supply the FEED PLAN for a husbandry -- which products, and how many
-- litres of each, DR should route into its food pool this pass.
--
-- WHY A SEPARATE FILE: SmartDistribution.lua's main chunk sits at Lua's hard
-- 200-local ceiling (CLAUDE.md 1.1), so this cannot live there. Same reasoning
-- as DistributionStats.lua. It must load AFTER SmartDistribution.lua (see
-- modDesc extraSourceFiles) because it hangs fields off that table.
--
-- IT DOES NOTHING UNLESS SOMETHING IS PLUGGED INTO IT, and that is layered
-- rather than promised:
--   1. `collectFoodSlots` already returns on its first line when
--      `feedHusbandryEnabled` is off, so the hook is NEVER REACHED on a farm
--      that is not auto-feeding animals.
--   2. `isEnrolled` is false for a husbandry when `includeHusbandry` is off, so
--      those buildings are skipped before the hook too.
--   3. With no provider registered, `feedPlanFor` returns nil on a single
--      numeric test and the original best-quality-first path runs BYTE FOR
--      BYTE as before.
-- So on a stock install this file costs one comparison per husbandry per hour
-- and changes nothing.
--
-- CONTRACT

--   content.page on registerOverviewTab, a PAGE the tab navigates to   -- v15
--   SmartDistribution.API.overviewTabs() / selectOverviewTab(i)        -- v15
--
--   A PAGE CONVENTION, not a function to call (v14): a page added with addMenuPage may
--   define  page:stepPageTabBy(delta) -> boolean  to have the menu's A and D keys step
--   ITS OWN tab strip. delta is -1 or +1, the page wraps at both ends, and it returns
--   true only if a tab actually moved -- returning false leaves the key unclaimed, so
--   A / D never become keys that silently do nothing. DR's own pages inherit a default
--   that drives the shared tab registry; a mod with a strip of its own just implements
--   the method. Nothing to register and nothing to version-test: an older DR never calls
--   it, and the page keeps its own buttons and arrows either way.
--   plan entry `ordered = true`                                        -- v11
--   SmartDistribution.API.deliverableLitres(placeable, ft)             -- v12
--
--   fn(placeable, allowedFillTypes, poolNeed) -> plan | nil
--
--   A plan is EITHER (v2, preferred)
--       { { fillTypes = { ftA, ftB }, litres = n }, ... }
--     where each entry's fillTypes are ALTERNATIVES -- any of them satisfies that
--     request, and DR chooses by what is actually in stock and nearest. This
--     matters because a planner cannot see the farm's stock: naming one product
--     and hoping is how a pig pen starves on maize while its sorghum sits unused.
--   v11: an entry may carry `ordered = true`. Its fillTypes are then a RANKING, best
--     first, and DR draws from them in that order -- nearest source only breaking a
--     tie -- instead of by the food-quality map. Without it DR ranks by quality, which
--     puts a complete ration such as pig food ahead of every crop however dear it is.
--   OR (v1, still accepted)
--       { [fillTypeIndex] = litres }
--     normalised internally to one single-alternative entry each.
--
--     placeable         the husbandry
--     allowedFillTypes  array of fill types DR will accept here THIS pass --
--                       already filtered for the excluded list, water, and any
--                       product the player blocked in Advanced Inputs. A plan
--                       may only name these; anything else is dropped.
--     poolNeed          litres DR wants to add to the pool this pass
--     return            absolute litres per fill type, or nil to DECLINE and
--                       leave DR's own behaviour in place
--
-- A planner is called INSIDE the hourly pass, so it must be cheap and must not
-- write game state. It is pcall'd, and one that throws three times is struck
-- out for the session rather than breaking the pass every hour.

-- THE HUSBANDRY PANEL (API v4). A mod supplies the FACTS about a barn -- herd,

-- INCOMING and OUTGOING tables on the Animal Husbandry tab.
--
-- DR OWNS THE LAYOUT, THE PROVIDER OWNS THE DATA, exactly as registerFeedPlanner

-- into DR's page could break the page for everyone, and the geometry here is

-- ===========================================================================
-- MENU EXTENSION (API v3)
--
-- A mod may add its own tab to DR's consolidated menu. TabbedMenu:addPage is a
-- documented runtime API, so the mechanism is the base game's; what DR adds is
-- the three things a mod cannot get right on its own.
--
--   1. TIMING. DR registers its menu on Mission00.loadMission00Finished, and a
--      mod that appends to the same hook may run BEFORE it -- Husbandry Redux does,
--      because mods load alphabetically and its chunk appends first. So
--      SmartDistribution._menu does not exist yet at the moment a mod would
--      naturally reach for it. onMenuReady fires AFTER the menu is built, and
--      immediately if it already is, so registration order stops mattering.
--   2. THE ICON. TabbedMenu:addPage takes a texture FILE and UVs, but DR's own
--      tabs use base-game icon SLICES (addPageTab's fourth argument). A mod
--      wanting a stock icon cannot express that through addPage.
--   3. THE LAYOUT. On a display wider than 16:9 DR widens its own design units
--      (CLAUDE.md 6.15) around its own g_gui:loadGui calls only. A page loaded
--      by a mod would come out narrow beside every DR tab. loadMenuPage applies
--      the same treatment.
--
-- Additive: v2 planners are untouched, and a mod can feature-detect these by
-- testing for the function rather than by comparing versions.

---Add a page as a tab. `sliceId` is a base-game icon slice (e.g.
-- "gui.icon_ingameMenu_animals"); `badgeSliceId` is an OPTIONAL second slice drawn
-- small in the corner of the same tab, for a page that is about two things at once
-- (the base game allows a tab exactly one icon, and its icons are slices inside
-- dataS.gar, so two of them cannot be merged into a file); `title` is the tab's
-- name -- pass it, because
-- the base game's fallback looks up "ui_<pageName>" in ITS namespace and a mod
-- key will never be found there.
-- ATOMIC. This mutates several of the menu's internal tables, and a failure part
-- way through leaves DR's menu unusable -- which is exactly what happened the
-- first time: registerPage put the page into pageFrames, the paging element never
-- learned about it, and rebuildTabList then threw on every frame
-- (idPageHash[nil].disabled), taking the whole menu down. A pcall stops the error
-- propagating; it does NOT undo a half-applied change.
--
-- So: every step records how to undo itself, the result is VERIFIED before being
-- kept, and anything short of complete success is rolled back. An extension mod
-- must not be able to break DR's own menu, however wrong its page is.
--
-- ORDER MATTERS. The page is given to the paging element FIRST, because that is
-- both what parents it (an unparented page renders nothing) and what registers
-- it in idPageHash. Only then is TabbedMenu told about it. addElement is used
-- rather than addPage: addElement is present in the shipped source and passes the
-- ELEMENT ITSELF, which is what rebuildTabList later looks up. addPage is

--
-- THE TAB ONLY EXISTS WHILE THE MOD DOES. Nothing here is declared by DR: the

-- "## " is a heading, blank lines separate paragraphs, and long lines are wrapped
-- at render time. Do NOT hand-wrap: the page word-wraps to its own column count
-- and a pre-wrapped paragraph comes out ragged.

---A TAB ON THE OVERVIEW PAGE (v13).
--
-- The Overview is DR's whole-network view, and a mod with a network-wide view of its own belongs
-- beside it rather than on a left icon of its own. Same shape as the settings and help tabs:
--   `label`   already localised -- DR cannot resolve another mod's l10n namespace (5.60)
--   `content` a table, or a bare string taken as `placeholder`
--
-- `content.placeholder`  text shown centred while this tab is active. What a mod uses before it
--                        has anything to draw, and it is the mod's own string for the same reason
--                        the label is.
-- `content.onShow` /     called when the tab is entered and left, so a mod can reveal and hide
-- `content.onHide`       elements of its own once it has some. Both optional and both pcall'd --
--                        this runs inside DR's page, where a throw aborts the render and shows as
--                        an EMPTY PAGE with nothing in the log (5.44 / 5.57).
--
-- `content.page` (v15)   a FRAME the mod has added with addMenuPage. Selecting the tab then
--                        NAVIGATES to that page instead of swapping content in place, and the
--                        page leaves the left list: it shows up as the Overview's row, so the
--                        highlight stays there. The page draws the Overview's strip itself from
--                        overviewTabs() and moves along it with selectOverviewTab(i) -- DR cannot
--                        paint into another mod's layout, so those two calls are the whole seam.
--                        Register it BEFORE addMenuPage, or the page is briefly a left row of
--                        its own until the next list rebuild.

-- honest "this mod registered a tab and has not filled it in"; inventing a caption would put DR's
