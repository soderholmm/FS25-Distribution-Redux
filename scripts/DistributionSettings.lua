DistributionSettings = {}
DistributionControls = {}   -- separate callback target (reference-mod pattern)

-- ---- setting definitions ---------------------------------------------------
-- Each: order (display position); default (INDEX into values); values (applied to
-- the engine); strings (the selector's value labels).
--
-- WHERE THE PLAYER-FACING TEXT LIVES, since it is deliberately not all here:
--   * row TITLE + TOOLTIP  -> gui/DistributionSettingsPage.xml, as
--                             $l10n_dr_set_<id> and $l10n_dr_set_<id>_tt.
--     A setting needs a hand-authored row in that file or it silently does not
--     appear at all (CLAUDE.md 5.41) -- adding one is still a two-file job.
--   * value LABELS         -> translations/translation_<lang>.xml, as
--                             dr_set_<id>_v1, _v2, ... resolved by convention in
--                             DistributionSettingsPage:onGuiSetupFinished.
--     `strings` below is the ENGLISH FALLBACK for those, and stays in step with
--     `values` -- the two are index-parallel and that is what the save file and
--     the multiplayer settings event carry.
--
-- There used to be `label` and `tooltip` fields here too. They were read by
-- NOTHING (dead since the options-page injection was dropped), and had already
-- drifted from the live XML wording on advancedRouting and palletSpawnMode -- two
-- copies of every tooltip, one of them wrong and invisible. Removed with the l10n
-- pass rather than translated twice.

--     dial for the machine the menu is open on, not world state. Profile-wide so one choice serves

-- STARTING A NEW GAME USED TO LOSE EVERY SETTING. Reported and then reproduced deliberately
-- 2026-08-09: new game -> place buildings -> change DR settings -> save -> reload -> all settings back
-- at hard defaults. Modes survived, which is what narrowed it to this file (smartDistribution.xml has
-- no equivalent gate). The chain, every step visible in one log:
--
--   1. a NEW GAME has no savegame folder yet -- it is created BY the first save -- so
--      missionInfo.savegameDirectory is nil and savegameDir() falls back to a GUESS (authoritative=false)
--   2. load() finds no file at the guessed path, hits its "a guess is not evidence of absence" guard
--      (correct, and there for the dedicated server) and returns with _loaded FALSE
--   3. this function was gated on _loaded, so EVERY save that session was skipped -- including the one
--      the game's own save hook fires ("SAVE skipped: settings not loaded yet")
--   4. so distributionSettings.xml never reached tempsavegame/, and the folder swap left the new
--      savegame with no settings file at all (see installSaveHook below for the swap)
--   5. next load: authoritative, file absent -> seedFromProfile -> "NEW savegame, hard defaults"
--
-- The gate itself is right; refusing an ad-hoc write during the deferred window still protects a live
-- farm. What was wrong is refusing the GAME SAVE, because skipping that does not preserve the old file,
-- it DESTROYS it. So the deferral now applies only to non-authoritative callers (a menu change), while
-- an authoritative one -- the save hook, writing into tempsavegame/ -- always resolves the situation
-- first via adoptPendingWorldSettings and then writes.
--
-- dir is resolved BEFORE the gate now, because the gate needs `authoritative` to tell those two apart.
-- savegameDir() has no side effects, so the reorder changes nothing else.

-- The discriminator is the LIVE savegame folder, rebuilt from savegameIndex. It cannot come from
-- savegameDir(): during a save the engine points savegameDirectory at .../tempsavegame/, which is where
-- we are writing TO, never where the existing file lives.

--
-- distributionSettings.xml was written only at load and on each option change, straight into
-- savegame<N>/ -- so every game save deleted it, every reload found nothing, and the settings came back
-- seeded from the profile. The tell was in the log: EVERY load printed "first load: EXISTING savegame
-- -- migrated" instead of "LOAD fired", i.e. the file was absent every single time.
--
-- smartDistribution.xml never had this problem because it has always been written from THIS hook. The
-- fix is simply to do the same, and to hand save() the missionInfo we are given so it resolves the
