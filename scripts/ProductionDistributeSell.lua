-- =============================================================================
-- ProductionDistributeSell.lua
-- =============================================================================
-- Adds two production output modes, "Distribute + Sell" and "Distribute + Store",
-- selectable from the vanilla production screen's existing output toggle.
--
--   * Click detection: the production frame reads getOutputDistributionMode(ft)
--     and immediately calls setOutputDistributionMode(ft, next, nil). We treat a
--     set as a user click when the immediately-preceding get was for the same
--     (pp, ft). Savegame load calls set with no preceding get -> absolute write.
--   * Each click advances a 4-state virtual mode and writes the real vanilla flag:
--         KEEP -> 0,  DISTRIBUTE -> AUTO_DELIVER,
--         SELL -> STORE + MODE.SELL (mod sells at best price) for priced goods, or
--                 DIRECT_SELL for price-less outputs (e.g. grid electricity/methane),
--         DISTRIBUTE+SELL -> AUTO_DELIVER (+ engine override MODE.DISTRIBUTE_SELL).
--     DISTRIBUTE+SELL uses the AUTO_DELIVER flag so the base engine distributes
--     the surplus; the remainder is sold in our own hourly pass (HOOK 3).
--   * The 4th mode is labelled in the production output list through the frame's
--     populateCellForItemInSection (the row's "activity" cell).
--   * State lives in the engine override (MODE.DISTRIBUTE_SELL), so it persists
--     across save/reload and is inert if this file is removed.
--
-- Remove the feature: delete this file + its <sourceFile> line in modDesc.xml.
-- Multiplayer-safe: the vanilla mode event only carries the 3 base states, so the
-- extended modes are synced with our own ProductionOutputModeEvent (below).
