-- DistributionModWarning.lua  (Distribution Redux)
--
-- KNOWN PROBLEM MODS. Some mods do the same job as DR, or reach into the same
-- state, and the result is two mods fighting over one decision. The player is
-- not told to remove anything -- they are told WHERE TO LOOK when something
-- misbehaves, which is the whole point: a silent collision costs an evening,
-- and a named one costs a minute.
--
-- THE LIST IS DATA, EDITED HERE. Add an entry by adding a row.
--
-- EVERY ENTRY CARRIES ITS REASON, and the reason is NOT shown to the player. It
-- is here for whoever maintains this list: without it, a name on a list is
-- unfalsifiable a year from now and nobody can tell whether it still belongs.
-- The dialog names the mods and stops there -- the player's job is to decide
-- what to run, not to read a diagnosis.
--
-- MATCHED ON THE MOD'S FOLDER / ZIP NAME, never its title. The title is
-- localised and editable; the name is what g_modIsLoaded is keyed by, which is
-- the same reasoning as persisting an animal subtype by name (Husbandry Redux 10.4).

---Show it, once per mission load -- EVERY load, with no way to switch it off.
--
-- Deliberately not a setting. A "do not show again" is a switch to forget the collision, and the
-- collision then comes back months later as a Distribution Redux bug report. It costs one dismissal
-- per load and it is the cheapest diagnosis in the mod.
--
-- DEFERRED TO THE FIRST TICK, not shown from the load hook. The same reason
-- runOrphanCheck defers (6.19): at load time the world is still assembling and
-- the GUI is not necessarily up, and a dialog raised into a half-built screen is
-- the kind of thing that either does not appear or appears behind everything.
--
-- InfoDialog, one button. A "quit to menu" button was considered and dropped: the
-- call is not readable (InGameMenu.lua is 96% blank, Mission00 is absent, and no
-- installed mod performs a quit), and the message tells the player how to do it
-- themselves in one line. Author's call, 2026-08-29.
