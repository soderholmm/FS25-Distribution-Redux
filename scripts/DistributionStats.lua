-- ============================================================================
-- DistributionStats.lua  (Distribution Redux)
-- Data behind the Overview tab: one row per (building, product) with Received /
-- Consumed / Held / Produced / Distributed / Stored-Moved / Sold, at three
-- timescales.
--
-- SmartDistribution.lua already keeps two of the three:
--   hour  -> S.lastCycle,  the last completed hourly pass
--   month -> monthlyRing,  a rolling 24-cycle window (24 hourly cycles = a month)
-- There was no year-scale ledger at all, so this file adds one: a rolling ring of
-- 12 MONTH BUCKETS. Each cycle is accumulated into the current bucket, and the
-- bucket advances every time the monthly window wraps -- i.e. once per month. The
-- year total is the sum of all 12, so it fills in over the first twelve in-game
-- months of a save rather than appearing complete on day one.
--
-- WHY A SEPARATE FILE: SmartDistribution.lua's main chunk sits at Lua's hard
-- 200-local-per-function ceiling (see CLAUDE.md 1.1), so the ring's state cannot
-- live there. A new file gets its own budget; the locals below are genuinely local
-- and cost the engine file nothing. It hooks in through four SmartDistribution.*
-- fields that SmartDistribution.lua calls only if present:
--   rollYearWindow / saveYearWindow / loadYearWindow / yearAggregate
-- Loads AFTER SmartDistribution.lua (see modDesc extraSourceFiles).
--
-- Server-authoritative, like every other ledger here: the hourly pass only runs on
-- the host, and clients read the aggregate the host pushes (DistributionStatsEvent).

-- the way the Productions tab reads it (pp.storage:getFillLevel).

-- ---- end-product chain -----------------------------------------------------

-- Everything the farm is actually MAKING right now. This is what the "End product" filter offers,
-- rather than every product in the table -- wheat and diesel in a dropdown labelled "End product" would
-- be nonsense, and so would offering a product whose production line is switched off.
--
-- Each building kind is tested by the strongest signal it has:
--   PRODUCTION -- outputs of ENABLED lines only (`line.enabled`). Deliberately NOT gated on having
--     produced anything: an enabled line sitting starved is precisely what you would open the chain to
--     diagnose, so it must stay pickable.
--   HUSBANDRY  -- no line to switch off, so the only honest signal is whether the herd HAS produced it.
--     A cow barn's output set nominally includes every milk variant, so without this test a farm with no
--     buffalo would still be offered Buffalo Milk.
-- Note the deliberate asymmetry with buildProducerIndex below, which ignores all of this: you should not
-- be able to PICK a product nobody makes, but once picked the chain must still show a paused or idle
-- intermediate step.
--
-- The husbandry test uses the MONTH window rather than literally the last cycle. Same ledger, wider
-- lens: this list is rebuilt every ~2 s, and a single-cycle test would drop any slow or intermittent
-- producer out of the dropdown the moment it had a quiet hour, moving the player's selection under them.
-- 24 cycles is stable for anything genuinely in production and still excludes what the farm never makes.
-- Returns { { ft = index, name = title }, ... } sorted by name.
