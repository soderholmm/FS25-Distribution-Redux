-- ============================================================================
-- DistributionInputsDialog.lua  (Distribution Redux)
--
-- "Advanced Inputs" pop-up: governs what a building will accept ON THE WAY IN.
-- Opened from a receiving building (storage, husbandry or production). One row per
-- input product the building can hold, each offering:
--   Block / Allow    -- refuse this product entirely (or allow it again)
--   -  /  +          -- raise / lower this product's MAX % of the (pooled) capacity
--
-- POOLED vs INDIVIDUAL is shown explicitly. A pooled store (hay loft: hay + straw share
-- one slot pool; a husbandry's FOOD pool; a multi-product bulk tank) is where one product
-- CAN starve another -- but it is first-come by default: every product may use 100% of the
-- pool, exactly as the base game would, and a max is a private ceiling the player sets on
-- ONE product to hold room back for the rest.
--
-- Caps therefore do NOT have to sum to 100%. Pooled products used to default to an even
-- split (250k / 2 products -> 50% each), which broke down completely on a mod-heavy silo:
-- past 200 products the rounded share reached 0% and the silo accepted nothing at all.
-- See defaultInputCapLiters in SmartDistribution.lua for the full reasoning.
--
-- Individual per-product tanks (straw, water, a single-product silo) can't starve each
-- other, so a max there is purely a fine-tune.
--
-- The % is shown with its live litre equivalent ("50%  (125,000 L)") so the player
-- always sees the real number, and because it's a PERCENT it rides capacity changes
-- (a silo extension) with no re-tuning. Every edit goes through DistributionControlEvent.
--
-- SECOND TABLE (2026-08-27): beneath the products sits the SOURCE DRILL-DOWN -- for whichever product
-- is selected, every building that could supply it, with its picture, range, the litres it could
-- actually hand over, and one of five statuses. It answers the question the product list cannot:
-- "why is nothing arriving?" Data comes from SmartDistribution.inputSourceRows; the statuses and the
-- order they resolve in are documented there.
--
-- TWO LISTS, ONE DELEGATE. Every list callback branches on `list`. The one that matters is
-- onListSelectionChanged: an unguarded assignment there would let the lower table repoint rowIndex and
-- so aim the Block / Max / Target buttons at a row other than the one they highlight.

-- ---- FOOTER KEYS -----------------------------------------------------------
-- A ButtonElement's input action is DISPLAY ONLY -- it draws the key glyph and nothing acts on it
-- (grepped: the only readers in the engine are ButtonElement and InputGlyphElementUI). A dialog that
-- wants the key to work has to handle it itself, the way YesNoDialog:inputEvent does.
--
-- Reported 2026-08-26 as "every footer button shows the Enter glyph". TWO faults, and the second is why
-- the first mattered:
--   * the XML attribute ButtonElement reads is `#inputAction`; DR wrote `inputActionName`, which is
--     never read. So every button fell through to the buttonOK PROFILE's action and drew the same glyph.
--   * and no dialog overrode inputEvent, so NONE of the keys did anything anyway. The glyphs were not
--     merely identical, they were claiming keys that did not exist.
-- This also retires 5.4's "5th/6th-action key-glyph scramble": that was never a limit on how many
-- actions a footer could carry, it was this typo making every extra button look the same.
--
-- OUR ACTIONS ARE HANDLED BEFORE THE SUPERCLASS CALL, and that is not cosmetic ordering. The first
-- version delegated first and acted only on `not eventUsed` -- and MENU_PAGE_NEXT never arrived, so
-- "+ Reserve" did nothing while "- Reserve" (MENU_PAGE_PREV) worked. Something above consumes NEXT and
-- not PREV. Claiming ours first sidesteps whatever that is, and passing eventUsed=true down still tells
-- the base the event is spoken for. Safe here because these are MessageDialogs: no tabs to page, and the
-- lists use MENU_LIST_PAGE_* rather than MENU_PAGE_*.
--
-- MENU_BACK is deliberately NOT claimed -- the close button owns it (Esc). MENU_CANCEL is Backspace, far
-- enough from an accidental press for the bulk "all" button.
--
-- Worth keeping even though it is no longer used: a profile declaring an EMPTY inputAction fails the
-- InputAction[name] lookup in ButtonElement:loadProfile and leaves a button with NO glyph at all --
-- confirmed in game 2026-08-26. That is the way to make a footer button genuinely mouse-only.
