-- TextPicker.lua -- A NUMBER YOU TYPE, with the arrows still there.
--
-- Requested 2026-09-02: a control to be used anywhere a number is picked, tested
-- first on the auto trader's "How many each time". A selector ring is the wrong
-- instrument for a bounded number -- reaching 47 out of 1..100 is 47 clicks, so
-- every ring in this mod is a CURATED list (1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10,12,15,20,25,30,40,
-- 50) and every value between them is simply unreachable. Typing 47 is one
-- gesture, and the arrows stay for the small nudges they are actually good at.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- THIS FILE IS MEANT TO BE COPIED VERBATIM INTO DR, NOT CALLED ACROSS MODS.
-- DR 5.87 ruled that AR must be able to stand alone and that DR must never
-- depend on AR, so a shared widget cannot be a runtime call in either direction.
-- But a control with a parse, a clamp, a wrap and a placeholder rule is real
-- BEHAVIOUR, which is exactly what DR 5.69 promoted out of a GUI file after 6.18
-- recorded three regressions caused by copying helpers between pages. The
-- resolution is the one the page-tab registry reached from the other side: ONE
-- SOURCE FILE, copied, each mod loading its own under its own namespace.
--
-- So this file knows NOTHING about Husbandry Redux. No globals, no l10n lookups --
-- the words are handed in, the pattern AnimalSellPolicy.textFor already uses
-- ("l10n is handed in so this module stays free of any GUI dependency").
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- THE PURE HALF IS SEPARATE FROM THE ELEMENT HALF, deliberately. parse,
-- stepValue and isDigit are plain functions over plain values and are what the
-- harness drives; render is the only thing that touches a GuiElement. A control
-- whose wrapping arithmetic can only be tested by opening a dialog is a control
-- whose wrapping arithmetic does not get tested.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHAT THE BASE GAME GIVES, read from TextInputElement.lua (22% blank, 38
-- functions -- COMPLETE, so an absence there is real, CLAUDE.md 8.1):
--
--   onIsUnicodeAllowed  raised from getIsUnicodeAllowed, and a false return
--                       REJECTS the character before it is inserted. That is the
--                       digits-only filter exactly -- not a scrub of the text
--                       afterwards, which would fight the cursor position.
--   onEnterPressed      raised on return AND on a click outside when
--                       enterWhenClickOutside is set. setForcePressed(false) runs
--                       BEFORE it, so by the time we are called the field has
--                       already released the keyboard and render may write to it.
--   onEscPressed        abandons the edit.
--   onTextChanged       every insertion and deletion; this is what takes the
--                       prompt down as the first character lands.
--
-- AND WHAT IT DOES NOT GIVE: a placeholder. imePlaceholder is for the console IME
-- overlay only and never reaches the field. So the grey prompt is a SEPARATE Text
-- element sitting over the box, which is also the only shape that cannot go
-- wrong -- a prompt held in the field's own text becomes real input the moment a
-- character is appended to it ("Enter number...5").
--
-- IT CANNOT STEAL THE CLICK: TextElement declares no mouseEvent of its own, and
-- GuiElement:mouseEvent only propagates to its children and returns what they
-- return. Verified in the shipped source rather than assumed, because a prompt
-- that ate the click would make the field unfocusable and look like a dead
-- control -- a symptom nothing like its cause.

-- which on a 500,000 L silo is 25,000 a press where 1 is meaningless.

-- IT CLAMPS TO THE END BEFORE IT WRAPS, and with step 1 that is the same function.
-- Stepping 98 by 5 in a 0..100 range must reach 100, not skip it and land on 0 --
-- so a step that would overshoot stops at the end, and only a press made FROM the
-- end wraps. At step 1 there is no difference: from maxV the old code wrapped and so
