-- ============================================================================
-- DistributionRoutingDialog.lua  (Distribution Redux) -- the ROUTING graph
--
-- COMPLETE (CLAUDE.md 5.106-5.115). Seven columns of real data, squared connectors,
-- SELECTION (click an input or an output to re-point the column beyond it), a per-edge
-- TOGGLE on the two routable gaps, four BLOCK ALL buttons, drag-and-drop FILL ORDER on
-- the destinations, typed Max in / Target / Reserve fields, wheel SCROLLING on every
-- column, and a DOUBLE CLICK on any building to open its own tab. Chosen over the
-- classic list dialogs by the `routingView` setting (SmartDistribution.routingViewEnabled).
--
--     sources | inputs | in-storages | BUILDING | out-storages | outputs | destinations
--
-- NO ENGINE WORK AT ALL. Every column is already computed by machinery that
-- ships and is already MP-safe:
--   col 1  SmartDistribution.inputSourceRows(consumerUid, ft)     5.77 / 5.79
--   col 2  SmartDistribution.receiverInputFillTypes(p, role)      5.65
--   col 3  SmartDistribution.pooledInputCapacity(p, role).groups  5.67d
--   col 4  SmartDistribution.assetIconFile(p)                     5.71
--   col 5  the same pool groups, read from the output side
--   col 6  SmartDistribution.internalProcessFillTypes(p)          (the Overview's own In/Out authority)
--   col 7  SmartDistribution.outputDestinationsForMode(p, ft)
-- This is a presentation build over finished mechanism, which is rare here.
--
-- MEMBERSHIP IS THE EXISTING RULE, NOT A NEW ONE (author's ruling 2026-09-21):
-- "same rules as for the existing advanced input/output; blocked should still be
-- there and be visible that it is blocked." So col 1 is inputSourceRows' own
-- membership verbatim -- which already drops markets, globally excluded fill
-- types, unenrolled buildings and input-only stockers -- and all six of 5.79's
-- statuses are drawn, colour-coded, including OUT_OF_RANGE. Nothing is filtered
-- out here that the Advanced Inputs drill-down would have shown.
--
-- ---- THE TWO GEOMETRY RULES THIS PAGE RESTS ON ----
--
-- 1. CONNECTORS ARE SQUARED, so nothing here is ever rotated. Step 1 proved a GUI
--    quad CAN be rotated and that the engine does it in SCREEN space (5.106); the
--    squared form needs none of that, which is its real attraction beyond the
--    look. See drawSeg: a horizontal bar is EDGE_PX / screenHeight tall and a
--    vertical one EDGE_PX / screenWidth wide, so both render the same thickness
--    at any aspect ratio with no angle and no pivot.
--
-- 2. THE Y AXIS INSIDE THE CANVAS POINTS UP. Directly inside fs25_menuContainer
--    a child takes a NEGATIVE y measured down from the top; inside an ordinary
--    container y is measured UP from the bottom. Two builds of step 1 drew
--    nothing because of this. The canvas and everything in it uses the second.

-- another, and `1.646 kL` beside `898 L` is harder to compare at a glance than `1,646` beside
-- `898`. `SmartDistribution.formatVolume` is untouched, so every other screen is unaffected --
-- the convention is broken HERE, in one function, rather than moved for the whole mod.

-- routing graph is read to compare quantities, and "1.646 kL" beside "898 L" is harder to compare
-- at a glance) -- but that argument is about the FLOW and HELD figures, which sit in a column and
-- are read against one another. A settings line is a readout of what one product is configured to
-- do, it is not compared across rows, and it has to carry TWO figures in a 98px cell: "max
-- 173,600 L  tgt 86,800 L" is 27 characters where 23 fit, while "max 174 kL  tgt 87 kL" is 21.

--
-- Reported in game: blocking a link left its connector GREEN. Nothing was cached and pressing
-- Refresh would not have helped -- the status word was stale BY DESIGN. `inputSourceRows` ranks
-- FEEDING above everything (5.79: "a source that is visibly working is never labelled by a
-- reason it might not be"), so a source that moved product on the LAST COMPLETED PASS goes on
-- reading FEEDING for the rest of the in-game hour however it is now configured. The two facts
-- are in different tenses -- "it moved last hour" is the past, "it is blocked" is now -- and it
-- is the second that says what happens NEXT.
--
-- Read off the toggle rather than off the word, because the toggle asks `isDestBlocked` LIVE
-- (see togFor, which does this for exactly the same reason one element over). So the chip and
-- the bar it sits on can never contradict each other, which is the invariant that matters on a
-- picture: a red chip on a green line is worse than either alone.
--
-- The drill-down TABLE keeps 5.79's precedence untouched -- this is the line's colour on this
-- page, not a change to what the word means. Known and accepted: a link that is BOTH blocked
-- and out of range now draws red, where 5.79 would say "out of range" because distance is not
-- something the player can press a button about. The chip beside it is already red in that
-- case, so agreeing with it is still the lesser of the two wrongs.
