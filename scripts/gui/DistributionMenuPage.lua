-- ---- adaptive backoff -------------------------------------------------------
-- The "Menu refresh rate" setting cannot be the whole answer to a farm too big to refresh, because it sits
-- BEHIND the menu: a player whose menu is unusable cannot reach the control that would make it usable.
-- Defaulting the setting to Manual would dodge that, but at the cost of every NORMAL farm silently showing
-- stale figures, which most players would read as the mod being broken.
--
-- So the menu measures itself instead and paces its own refreshes to what the farm can actually afford. A
-- normal farm never leaves the rate the player chose; a pathological one settles within a few refreshes at
-- a pace it can sustain, with no setting to find. The chosen rate is a FLOOR -- this only ever stretches
-- the interval, never tightens it past what was asked for.
--
-- Class-level, not per-page, because it is a property of the FARM: what the Overview learns the building
-- tabs should not have to re-learn by hitching again.
-- The rule is a DUTY CYCLE, not a threshold: never spend more than 1/REFRESH_DUTY of wall-clock time
-- refreshing. So the interval is proportional to what a refresh actually costs, which is what makes the
-- response proportionate -- a 140 ms refresh stretches to ~2.8 s and stays usefully live, where a
-- doubling-on-threshold scheme jumped it straight to the cap and made the figures needlessly stale. A
-- genuinely pathological 4 s refresh lands on the MAX_INTERVAL cap, i.e. effectively manual.
--
-- The cost is SMOOTHED, so one unlucky frame (a GC pause, a stutter from elsewhere) cannot pin the
-- interval; it decays back within a few refreshes.
